# Python-Chat-Application

Welcome to my Chat Application. I programmed this using prior knowledge of the Python programming langauge and new online resources. 
In order to work successfully, the server must run prior to the client. 
The programmer can specify how many clients they want to hold on their chat application.
Make sure that the server and client are running in two different Python shells. 

Have fun!
